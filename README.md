# AutoGit
Git is not beginner friendly. I myself have had a hard time learning Git. AutoGit is the same as Git, but it has easy to remember commands such as "sync" or "create"

# Help
- You can find the list of commands by typing "autogit help"

# Features
- Git repository template with README.md and .gitignore
- Stage and commit all
- Create, switch, and delete branches
- See modified and untracked files
- Sync the local repository with the remote repository

# Requirements
- Git
- Python 3.9.7 or higher
- GitPython

# Quick Start
Once you've cloned this repository and are running the `main.py` file, you can get started right away.

Use `autogit cd` to switch paths. `autogit cd` is the same as `cd`

Now use `autogit create` to create a new git repository template. You can see the list of **gitignore_templates** in the `gitignore_templates` folder.


Congratulations! You have just created a git repository with a README.md and a .gitignore in just TWO autogit commands!
